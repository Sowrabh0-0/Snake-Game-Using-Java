# Snake Game

## Description
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using Java and Swing. The objective of the game is to control the snake and eat fruits to grow longer. The game ends if the snake collides with itself. 

## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake's movement.
- Try to eat the fruits that appear on the screen to grow the snake and increase your score.
- Avoid colliding with the snake's body, as it will result in game over.
- The game will end if the snake collides with the boundaries of the game board.

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc.).

## Usage
1. Run the `SnakeGame.java` class to start the game.
2. The game window will open, and you can use the arrow keys to control the snake.
